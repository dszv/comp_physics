    "# Eigenvalues and eigenvectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Most problems in physics concern real symmetric matrices (or Hermitian matrices when complex numbers are involved).\n",
    "\n",
    "- For a symmetric matrix $A$, an *eigenvector* $v$ is a vector satisfying $A v = \\lambda v$ wwhere $\\lambda$ is the corresponding *eigenvalue*.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For an $N \\times N$ matrix there are $N$ eigenvectors $v_i$ with eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$. The eigenvectors are assumed to be mutually orthonormal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we wish we can consider $AV = VD$ where $D$ is the diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues as its diagonal entries and $V$ is the matrix with the eigenvectors as its columns. It is easy to see that $V$ is orthogonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The most widely used technique for calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors of real symmetric or Hermitian matrices on a computer is the QR algorithm. It works by calculating the matrices $V$ and $D$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The QR algorithm makes use of the QR decomposition of a matrix. This is a variant of the LU decomposition, in which the matrix is written as the product $QR$ of an orthogonal matrix $Q$ and an upper-triangular matrix $R$.\n",

    "4. Multiply $V$ on the right by $Q$. \n",

    "5. Check the off-diagonal elements of $A$. If they are all less than $\\epsilon $, we are done. Otherwise go back to step 2. \n",
