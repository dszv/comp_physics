    "- The discrete cosine transform is often preferable for data that are not inherently periodic.\n",
    "- One can also calculate discrete sine transforms although they are used less often than cosine transforms because they force the function $f(x)$ to be zero at either end of its range. Relatively few functions encountered in real-world applications do this, so the sine transform has limited applicability.\n",

    "- They form the mathematical basis for the computer image file format called JPEG. It works by dividing the pixels in an image into blocks, performing DCTs on the blocks (two-dimensional Type-II DCTs to be exact), then looking for coefficients that are small and can be discarded. The remaining coefficients are stored in a file and, when you view a picture or request the relevant web page, your computer reconstitutes the picture using the inverse transform.\n",
    "- A variant of the same technique is also used to compress moving pictures, meaning film and video, using the compression format called MPEG.\n",
    "- A similar scheme is used to compress music, for instance in the popular file format called MP3. MP3s are clever, however, in that the particular Fourier components they discard are not chosen solely on the grounds of which ones are smallest, but also with a knowledge of what the human ear can and cannot hear."
